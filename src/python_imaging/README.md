# Python Visualizations

`image_processing_for_physicell.py` contains the class `PhysiCellPlotter`. This class enables reproducible visualization with many options - including setting which layers to include (cell, ECM components, diffusing fields), positional tracking of cell movement history, and smoothly generating stills and movies sequentially. It uses a modified version of [`pyMCDS.py`](https://github.com/PhysiCell-Tools/python-loader) - `pyMCDS_ECM.py`. The modifications include loading ECM data .mat outputs and formatting that data for use in visualizations. 


## Scripts

Advanced scripts - using the PhysiCellPlotter class in `image_processing_for_physicell.py`. Place scripts in `output` or other directory at same level or alter path assignment. Examples used to produce stills and movies for [this preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.21.514608) are given below. Using the various options available in the PhysiCellPlotter class, other visualizations can be created. 
* `full_history_movie_script.py`: Generates movie using all available outputs and plots the full cell positional histories as well as current cell positions and ECM fiber element orientations. 
* `generic_movie_maker.py`: Generates a movie with default vizualization values. 
sys.path.append(r'../python_imaging')
* `full_history_still_script.py`: Generates still, ploting the full cell positional histories up to the point of the still as well as current cell positions and ECM fiber element orientations
*  `image_processing_script.py`: Generic example plotter. Outputs and shows a plot of the diffusing substrate and overlays cell positions. Loads frame 100. 
* `partial_history_2_level_contour_movie.py`: Generates of movie with each frame a recent portion of cell positional histories and anisotropy with 2 contour color levels (used for cases of instant ECM remodeling) as well as current cell positions and ECM fiber element orientations.
* `partial_history_2_level_contour_still.py`: Plots a recent portion of cell positional histories and anisotropy with 2 contour color levels (used for cases of instant ECM remodeling) as well as current cell positions and ECM fiber element orientations.
* `partial_history_multilevel_contour_movie.py`: Plots a recent portion of cell positional histories and anisotropy with multiple contour color levels as well as current cell positions and ECM fiber element orientations.
* `partial_history_multilevel_contour_still.py`: Generates of movie with each frame a recent portion of cell positional histories and anisotropy with multiple contour color levels as well as current cell positions and ECM fiber element orientations.


Basic scripts. Original basis for integrated plotter in `image_processing_for_physicell.py`. Included as basic original examples. Place scripts in `output` or other directory at same level or alter path assignment. 
* `basic_cell_plot.py`: create a plot with Cells plotted.
* `cell_plus_environment_movie_maker.py`: Generates a movie of the ECM anisotorpy and orientations with cell overlay. Alter as needed for need. 
* `cell_plus_environment_plotter.py`: Generates a still of the ECM anisotorpy and orientations with cell overlay. Alter as needed for need. 
* `cell_track_plotter.py`: Plots still of cells and cell positional histories. 
* `cell_tracker_movie.py`: Generates a movie of cells and cell positional histories.
* `finished-combined-plot.py`: Generates a layered plot combining cell positions and multiple aspcts of the microenvironment.
