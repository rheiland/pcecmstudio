<body><h1>Cell Hypothesis Rules (detailed)</h1>
<p>In tumor cells:
<ul>
<li>oxygen increases cycle entry from 1.7e-05 towards 0.0007 with a Hill response, with half-max 21.5 and Hill power 4.</li>
<li>pressure decreases cycle entry from 1.7e-05 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.25 and Hill power 3.</li>
<li>dead increases debris secretion from 0 towards 1 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 10.</li>
<li>oxygen decreases necrosis from 0.0028 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 3.75 and Hill power 8.</li>
</ul>
